| Sept 24   | 11:15am - 12:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                        Began by creating my problem set, and spent some time understanding runtime and how to best solve this problem set. When coding, I decided to first start with binary search, for proof of concept. The code works.. however, has a slow runtime (as we assessed in class) and hence times out during the longer tests. I am considering trying to do a log base 8 solution for future efficiency- splitting the problem into a TON of mini paths & trees. |
| Sept 28   | 12:30pm - 12:52pm |         Tried switching out my binary search solution for a hash-set solution, initially just replacing my arraylist with a hash set, to see if that sped up the process. Upon failure, realized that I should learn how to use hash-set's, and realized that the problem could be solved quite simply using them. Created a hash-set solution, which passess all the tests. However,I understand that there are likely memory issues with this solution (with too much space being used up), so I will probably re-iterate and try to solve more efficiently after class when we learn some more efficient solutions/algorithms. |
| October 5 |  7:45pm - 8:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                   Basically restarted from scratch upon learning the correct algorithm (using Trie's + TST's to solve). First began by thinking about how I will structure my solution-- orienting seperate classes (a Trie class, a TST class, and a Node class) so I can better abstract out the problem, and break it into smaller steps that are easier for me to handle. I then planned out each class, beginning with the node class, which I finished in this time period. |
| October 5 |   8:15- 8:45 pm   |                                                        I had just finished creating my Node class, and now am moving on to implementing my Trie class. I begun by looking into the slides, and my notes, and attempting to copy the structure. I am able to get it working for most of the test cases, except for Bard and Rome, where it is slightly off (like 150 off in word count). This is likley because of missing characters (either capitalization or commas/apostrophes im not sure which yet) but I'm going to move onto implementing my TST slightly differently-- seeing if it works, and coming back to this later. |
| October 5 |    8:45-9:15pm    | Moving on from my slightly disfunctional Trie, I began following the instructions for the TST, which for some reason, came more intuitively to me.. Maybe this is because of the examples we worked on in class, but the three paths made a lot more sense in my head. I do think my code fluency / number of lines written can definately be decreased (because when I noticed i needed a get and insert function I basically repeated a lot of code), and also, when I run it- sometimes it fails the runtime tests (very rarely.. but still. that can't be a good sign) Hence, I will have to come back to this later as well. |
| October 6 |   11:20-11:50am   |                                                     Coming back to my previous problems in class, I realized the reason for my Trie error was due to the fact that I was using only 26 characters, and excluding extended ascii values like apostrophes and hyphens. Solving this problem actually made my code easier, because all I had to do was delete certain lines of code that made sure it was a valid character, and index shifting it from 0-26, and increase the size of my node children array to 255. Once this was done, my Trie problems were all solved! I didn't have time to tackle my TST problems however.... |
| October 8 |    7:40-7:55am    |                                                             Upon looking at my almost finished code, and beginning to tackle some of my Trie confusion (seeing if its a code problem, or just a my machine dying inside problem).. I realized a bigger issue-- the fact that none of my commits actually properly pushed to git. So, now i'm going to push a giant commit with basically all of my work :( bad coding practice.. i know. After more looking into it, I can't really think about how best to get my TST to be more efficient, and hence, will likley ask during class (along with fixing my comments then as well) |
