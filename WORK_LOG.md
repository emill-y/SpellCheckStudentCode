| Sept 24 | 11:15am - 12:00pm |                                                                                                                                                               Began by creating my problem set, and spent some time understanding runtime and how to best solve this problem set. When coding, I decided to first start with binary search, for proof of concept. The code works.. however, has a slow runtime (as we assessed in class) and hence times out during the longer tests. I am considering trying to do a log base 8 solution for future efficiency- splitting the problem into a TON of mini paths & trees. |
| Sept 28 | 12:30pm - 12:52pm | Tried switching out my binary search solution for a hash-set solution, initially just replacing my arraylist with a hash set, to see if that sped up the process. Upon failure, realized that I should learn how to use hash-set's, and realized that the problem could be solved quite simply using them. Created a hash-set solution, which passess all the tests. However,I understand that there are likely memory issues with this solutio (with too much space being used up), so I will probably re-iterate and try to solve more efficiently after class when we learn some more efficient solutions/algorithms. |
